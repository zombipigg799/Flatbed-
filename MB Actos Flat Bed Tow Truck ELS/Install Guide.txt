Place the ELS Config in the ELS folder under pack_default (ELS folder located in the GTA V Main Directory)
Install the cars under the latest patchday, Found in mods>update>x64>dlcpacks>patchday14>dlc.rpf>x64>levels>gta5>vehicles.rpf) 


If the Model is not in there, still put it in. (In mine its patchday14)

Flatbed Ramp Posion For Arrest Manager.

This may need tweaking.
